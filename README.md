# Pinball-Wizard Game

**Overview**
This repository combines the excitement of a classic pinball game with a flexible physics simulation framework. Whether you're a game enthusiast looking for interactive gameplay or a physics enthusiast interested in simulations, this project has something for you.

**Key Componenents****
1. **Pinball Game:**
   - An interactive pinball game implemented in Python using the Zelle Graphics library. Navigate through an environment filled with obstacles such as balls, blocks, and triangles. Use the left and right arrows on the keyboard to control the movement of a rectangular block at the bottom to influence the trajectory of the balls. Enjoy real-time collision detection for an engaging gaming experience.

2. **Physics Simulation Framework:**
   - A versatile physics simulation framework with classes representing various objects. The `Thing` class serves as the parent class, and subclasses like `Ball`, `Block`, `Triangle`, and `New_Shape offer flexibility for diverse simulations. Explore the simulation of objects with defining attributes such as mass, velocity, and acceleration which influence the object interactiions in the game.
  
 ** Summary of Key Features of the Game**
 **Pinball Game:**
  - Obstacle creation with balls, blocks, and triangles.
  - User-controllable block for influencing ball trajectories.
  - Real-time collision detection for engaging gameplay.
  - Colorful graphics enhancing the visual appeal.

 **Physics Simulation Framework:**
  - Base class `Thing` with common attributes and methods.
  - Subclasses representing different shapes and objects.
  - The `Distinct_Ball` class introducing concentric circles for a visually distinct representation.


**How to Use**
Run the Python file named 'animated.py' and use the left and right arrows to control the trajectories of the ball.
